### Ay up ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UK based software engineer specialising in Windows desktop applications and web development with experience in both front and back end technologies.
I drink a silly amount of tea and write code.

Feel free to look thought my projects and if you have and questions or if you're working on something similar send me message I'm happy to chat and help out if I can.
